## üîé Exploring dataset & insights  

**Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)**

*Purpose*: To measure user interest and behavior in the first three months of the year, thereby determining traffic trends, engagement levels and shopping needs over time
-> Help businesses grasp the overall picture of performance at the beginning of the year, see when traffic and transactions are highest, as a basis for assessing seasonal fluctuations

```sql
SELECT  FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month_trans
        ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
        ,SUM(totals.pageviews) AS total_pageviews
        ,SUM(totals.transactions) AS total_transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix between '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month_trans
ORDER BY month_trans ASC
```
*Result*
| month_trans | total_visits | total_pageviews | total_transactions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 201701 | 64694 | 257708 | 713 |
| 201702 | 62192 | 233373 | 733 |
| 201703 | 69931 | 259522 | 993 |

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings: March saw a significant increase in visits and transactions compared to January and February, indicating improved conversions and user experience. February saw lower traffic and engagement, possibly due to seasonality or ineffective marketing campaigns.
- Recommendations:
  + Investigate the specific reasons for growth in March to apply to other months.
  + Boost marketing activities in February, focusing especially on improving content and user experience.
  + Plan advertising budget allocation according to monthly traffic trends.

**Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)**

*Purpose*: Identify low-quality traffic sources (high bounce rate), then develop a strategy to optimize ad spend or improve target content.

```sql
SELECT  trafficSource.source
        ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
        ,SUM(totals.bounces) AS num_bounce
        ,ROUND(SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits),3) AS bounce_rates
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170701
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY trafficSource.source ASC
```
*Result*
| source | total_visits | num_bounce | bounce_rates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (direct) | 335 | 181 | 0.54 |
| Partners | 17 | 11 | 0.647 |
| analytics.google.com | 19 | 13 | 0.684 |
| ask | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| baidu | 8 | 6 | 0.75 |

| web.facebook.com | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| yahoo | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| youtube.com | 162 | 121 | 0.747 |

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings: Some traffic sources have bounce rates above 60%, especially YouTube (0.747), analytics.google.com (0.684), Partners (0.647), and m.facebook.com (0.596). Even major sources like Google Search have relatively high bounce rates (0.566), indicating that many visitors do not continue to interact after landing on the page.
- Recommendations:
  + Review and optimize landing page content from high bounce rate sources, especially YouTube and social media
  + Reassess ad spend effectiveness on channels with high bounce rates and low conversions
  + A/B test ad messaging and landing page experiences to improve initial user engagement

**Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017**

*Purpose*: Track revenue generated from each traffic source, broken down by time (week/month), to understand which channels actually deliver financial value
-> allows businesses to evaluate financial performance by marketing channel and track short-term revenue fluctuations, serving campaign analysis or optimizing advertising spending

```sql
SELECT
    'Month' AS time_type
    ,FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', DATE(PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date))) AS time
    ,trafficSource.source AS source
    ,SUM(product.productRevenue) / 1000000 AS revenue
