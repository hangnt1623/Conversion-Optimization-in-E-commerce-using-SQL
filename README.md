## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project includes an eCommerce dataset that I explore by using SQL on Google BigQuery. The data originates from the Google Analytics public dataset and represents information from an eCommerce website.

The main business question this project aims to answer is: How does user behavior and traffic source impact key eCommerce metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rate, revenue, and product purchase patterns over time?



### 👤 Who is this project for?  
This project is for *business analysts, marketing teams, product managers, and data analysts* who need actionable insights into customer behavior, traffic sources, and sales performance to drive smarter business decisions and optimize the eCommerce experience.

- Format: (.csv, .sql, .xlsx, etc.)  

### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

#### 1️⃣ Tables Used:  
Mention how many tables are in the dataset.  

#### 2️⃣ Table Schema & Data Snapshot  

Table 1: Products Table  

👉🏻 Insert a screenshot of table schema 

📌If the table is too big, only capture a part of it that contains key metrics you used in the projects or put the table in toggle

 _Example:_
