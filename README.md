  <summary>üìä <strong>Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)</strong></summary>
****

*Purpose*: To measure user interest and behavior in the first three months of the year, thereby determining traffic trends, engagement levels and shopping needs over time
-> Help businesses grasp the overall picture of performance at the beginning of the year, see when traffic and transactions are highest, as a basis for assessing seasonal fluctuations

```sql
SELECT  FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month_trans
        ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
        ,SUM(totals.pageviews) AS total_pageviews
        ,SUM(totals.transactions) AS total_transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix between '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month_trans
ORDER BY month_trans ASC
```
*Result*
| month_trans | total_visits | total_pageviews | total_transactions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 201701 | 64694 | 257708 | 713 |
| 201702 | 62192 | 233373 | 733 |
| 201703 | 69931 | 259522 | 993 |

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings:
  + March 2017 shows peak performance with the highest visits (69,931), pageviews (259,522), and transactions (993), indicating stronger shopping intent and conversion during this month.
  + February 2017 had fewer visits and pageviews than January, yet generated more transactions, suggesting improved conversion efficiency despite shorter time (28 days).
  + Traffic volume alone doesn‚Äôt guarantee sales ‚Äî as seen in January (more visits than February but fewer transactions), highlighting the importance of engagement quality over quantity.
- Recommendations:
  + Double down on campaigns in March to capitalize on naturally high user intent and traffic.
  + Analyze February‚Äôs conversion strategies to replicate successful elements (e.g. UX, offers) across other months.
  + Focus on visit quality by optimizing landing pages and user journeys ‚Äî not just boosting raw traffic.

<details>
  <summary>üìä <strong>Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit)</strong></summary>
        
****

*Purpose*: Identify low-quality traffic sources (high bounce rate), then develop a strategy to optimize ad spend or improve target content.

```sql
SELECT  trafficSource.source
        ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
        ,SUM(totals.bounces) AS num_bounce
        ,ROUND(SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits),3) AS bounce_rates
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170701
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY bounce_rates DESC
```
*Result*

| source | total_visits | num_bounce | bounce_rates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| google.com | 7 | 2 | 286 |
| reddit.com | 4 | 1 | 0.25 |
| dfa | 1 |  |  |
| t.co | 1 |  |  |


*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings:
  + Several traffic sources like yahoo, quora.com, l.facebook.com, and others have a 100% bounce rate but very low visit counts, indicating minimal engagement from these niche or referral channels in July 2017.
  + Major sources such as google (56.6%), m.facebook.com (59.6%), and youtube.com (74.7%) show relatively high bounce rates despite high traffic volumes, suggesting a significant portion of visits are low-quality or non-engaging.
  + Direct traffic and smaller sources like bing (50%) and reddit.com (25%) show lower bounce rates, implying better visitor engagement from these channels during this period.
- Recommendations:
  + Refine ad targeting and content for high-volume but high-bounce sources (Google, mobile Facebook, YouTube) to improve user relevance and reduce bounce.
  + Consider reallocating budget away from very low-volume, 100% bounce sources unless strategic value justifies continued spend.
  + Enhance landing page experience and calls to action for traffic from major platforms to better capture and retain visitor interest in July 2017.

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings
  + From January to March 2017, both add-to-cart rates and purchase rates steadily improved, with add-to-cart rising from 28.47% to 37.29%, and purchase rate from 8.31% to 12.64%.
  + March shows the most significant lift, driven by a higher number of add-to-cart actions (+20% vs. Jan) and purchases (+39%), suggesting successful optimization efforts or seasonal demand.

  + Analyze and optimize checkout UX and payment processes during Jan‚ÄìMar to reduce friction causing purchase drop-offs.
  + Leverage insights from March‚Äôs uplift by identifying specific changes (campaigns, UX tweaks) and scaling them across all months.
