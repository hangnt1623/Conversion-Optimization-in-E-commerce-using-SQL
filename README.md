## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project includes an eCommerce dataset that I explore by using SQL on Google BigQuery. The data originates from the Google Analytics public dataset and represents information from an eCommerce website.

The main business question this project aims to answer is: How does user behavior and traffic source impact key eCommerce metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rate, revenue, and product purchase patterns over time?



### üë§ Who is this project for?  
This project is for *business analysts, marketing teams, product managers, and data analysts* who need actionable insights into customer behavior, traffic sources, and sales performance to drive smarter business decisions and optimize the eCommerce experience.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tables Used:  

There is a table are in the dataset.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Table Schema

| Field Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fullVisitorId | STRING | The unique visitor ID. |
| date | STRING | The date of the session in YYYYMMDD format. |
| totals | RECORD | This section contains aggregate values across the session. |

| totals.hits | INTEGER | Total number of hits within the session. |
| totals.pageviews | INTEGER | Total number of pageviews within the session. |
| totals.visits | INTEGER | The number of sessions (for convenience). This value is 1 for sessions with interaction events. The value is null if there are no interaction events in the session. |
| totals.transactions | INTEGER | Total number of ecommerce transactions within the session. |
| trafficSource.source | STRING | The source of the traffic source. Could be the name of the search engine, the referring hostname, or a value of the utm_source URL parameter. |

## üîé Exploring dataset & insights  

**Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)**

*Purpose*: To measure user interest and behavior in the first three months of the year, thereby determining traffic trends, engagement levels and shopping needs over time
-> Help businesses grasp the overall picture of performance at the beginning of the year, see when traffic and transactions are highest, as a basis for assessing seasonal fluctuations

```sql
SELECT  FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month_trans
        ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
        ,SUM(totals.pageviews) AS total_pageviews
        ,SUM(totals.transactions) AS total_transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix between '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month_trans
ORDER BY month_trans ASC
```
**Result**
| month_trans | total_visits | total_pageviews | total_transactions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 201701 | 64694 | 257708 | 713 |
| 201702 | 62192 | 233373 | 733 |
| 201703 | 69931 | 259522 | 993 |



**Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)**

*Purpose*: Identify low-quality traffic sources (high bounce rate), then develop a strategy to optimize ad spend or improve target content.

```sql
SELECT  trafficSource.source
        ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visits
        ,SUM(totals.bounces) AS num_bounce
        ,ROUND(SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits),3) AS bounce_rates
FROM bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170701
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY trafficSource.source ASC
```
**Result**
| source | total_visits | num_bounce | bounce_rates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017**

*Purpose*: Track revenue generated from each traffic source, broken down by time (week/month), to understand which channels actually deliver financial value
-> allows businesses to evaluate financial performance by marketing channel and track short-term revenue fluctuations, serving campaign analysis or optimizing advertising spending

```sql
SELECT
    'Month' AS time_type
    ,FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', DATE(PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date))) AS time
    ,trafficSource.source AS source
    ,SUM(product.productRevenue) / 1000000 AS revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*`
,UNNEST(hits) AS hit
,UNNEST(hit.product) AS product
WHERE product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY time, source

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Week' AS time_type
    ,FORMAT_DATE('%Y%W', DATE(PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date))) AS time
    ,trafficSource.source AS source
    ,SUM(product.productRevenue) / 1000000 AS revenue
